# How to Deploy Wordpress

[Source](/recipe/wordpress.php)

## How to deploy a Wordpress project with zero downtime?

- First, [install](/docs/installation.md) the Deployer. 
- Second, require `recipe/wordpress.php` recipe into your _deploy.php_ or _deploy.yaml_ file.
- Third, now you can have a zero downtime deployment!

Did you know that you can deploy **Wordpress** project with a single command? Just execute `dep deploy`.
Something went wrong? Just run `dep rollback` to rollback your changes.
Also, you can take an advantage of the [Deployer's CLI](/docs/cli.md) to deploy your project.

Another cool feature of the Deployer is [provisioning](/docs/recipe/provision.md). Take any server, and run `dep provision` command.
This command will configure webserver, databases, php, https, and more. 
You will get everything you need to run your **Wordpress** application.

Deployer does next steps to [deploy](#deploy) **Wordpress**:
* Displays info about deployment
* Prepares host for deploy
* Locks deploy
* Prepares release
* Updates code
* Creates symlinks for shared files and dirs
* Makes writable dirs
* Creates symlink to release
* Unlocks deploy
* Cleanup old releases


The wordpress recipe is based on the [common](/docs/recipe/common.md) recipe.
